[in progress] ContractManagementSystem is a web application based on a layered architecture, designed for managing contracts, their categories, and related data. The project implements design patterns such as Repository, Unit of Work, Dependency Injection, and DTO, ensuring clear separation of concerns and making the system easier to test and extend. The logic is divided into layers: API, Business Logic (BL), Data Access Layer (DAL), and Core, following the principles of clean architecture. Database communication is handled via Entity Framework Core, and the Core layer is built with a Domain-Driven Design approach.
